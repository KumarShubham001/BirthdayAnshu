				So,

			</p>
			<p class="text-xl/7 text-justify md:text-center mt-3">
				Anshu, I can‚Äôt help but think about last year, this very day, when we were in Manali. I remember every
				single
				moment we spent together‚Äîthe laughter, the warmth, the magic of the snowy landscapes. I wanted to give
				you
				the best birthday gift I could, a beautiful place that matched your beauty. And seeing you happy made it
				all
				worth it.
				<span class="underline decoration-pink-500">I am sorry yaar</span>, this year many things are not right,
				things are not aligning for us, even when I try to make everything good <span
					class="font-semibold">"perfect"</span>
				some or the other thing goes wrong. And that hurts, because all
				<span class="underline decoration-pink-500">I ever
					want is to be with you</span>‚Äîto spend every beautiful evening by your side, sipping chai and
				coffee,
				lost in endless conversations, stealing slow, soft kisses. I want to be
				with you, but please forgive me for this time,
				I could'nt be with you physically, but I am always there beside you, watching you from a distance and
				trying
				not to make you feel embarassed and disappointed in me. Whenever you miss me, just close your eyes‚Äî<span
					class="underline decoration-pink-500">I
					promise, I‚Äôll be there, holding you in my heart</span>. I miss you my sweet heart. And I‚Äôm trying,
				with
				all that I have, to make things okay again‚Äî<i>not just like before, but even better</i>. Trust me and
				trust
				the process. I love you.
				<br>
				I love you, always. ‚ù§Ô∏è

				<li>You are my sukun</li>
				<li>I like listening to you, travelling with you, sleeping in your arms, in your lap</li>
				<li>I like walking with you, hands in hands, and those awkward moments where you start talking nonsense
				</li>
				<li>I like the moments of fast walks and when I always use to loose to you (intentionally) and then you
					celebrated your wins</li>
				<li>I like making morning coffee for you, "the perfect coffee"</li>
				<li>I like waking up next to you, watching your messed-up face, sleeping peacefully, just you being you
				</li>
				<li>I like when you look at me, those glittering eyes</li>

					you, providing for you.
					<span class="underline decoration-pink-500">There's nothing better happened to me than you coming in
						my life</span>. I
					still remember the time when you
					walked in my classroom for the first time in std 9, and that "ting" in my heart. All that chaos,
					and
					then, that "ting". A moment so pure and magical that I knew, right then and there, I was already
					yours. Since that day,
					nothing has ever mattered to me as much as you. I never truly understood what it meant to care for
					someone until I started caring for you. <span class="underline decoration-pink-500">Your
						mere exsistance gives me a purpose</span>. I have already planned everything in my head.
					A beautiful house, a decent car, classic 350, backyard, pool, with cuties playing in sand and a life
					filled with endless
					love
					and laughter. Ahhh... man I can
					already feel
					the peace <span class="font-semibold">"The sukun"</span>.
