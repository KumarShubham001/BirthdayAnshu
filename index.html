			<span>Wishing you a <span class="underline decoration-pink-500">Very Very Happy Birthday</span>.</span> So,
			you turned 29 this year‚Äîinteresting. üòä<br>
			I can‚Äôt help but think about last year, this very day, when we were in Manali. I remember every single
			moment we spent together‚Äîthe laughter, the warmth, the magic of the snowy landscapes. I wanted to give you
			the best birthday gift I could, a beautiful place that matched your beauty. And seeing you happy made it all
			worth it.
			<span class="underline decoration-pink-500">I am sorry yaar</span>, this year many things are not right,
			things are not aligning for us, even when I try to make everything good <span
				class="font-semibold">"perfect"</span> some or the other thing goes wrong. And that hurts, because all
			<span class="underline decoration-pink-500">I ever
				want is to be with you</span>‚Äîto spend every beautiful evening by your side, sipping chai and coffee,
			lost in endless conversations, stealing slow, soft kisses. I want to be
			with you, but please forgive me for this time,
			I could'nt be with you physically, but I am always there beside you, watching you from a distance and trying
			not to make you feel embarassed and disappointed in me. Whenever you miss me, just close your eyes‚Äî<span
				class="underline decoration-pink-500">I
				promise, I‚Äôll be there, holding you in my heart</span>. I miss you my sweet heart. And I‚Äôm trying, with
			all that I have, to make things okay again‚Äî<i>not just like before, but even better</i>. Trust me and trust
			the process. I love you.
			<br>
			I love you, always. ‚ù§Ô∏è

			10
		</span> reasons I why I love you and cannot imagine my life without you:</h3>
		<ul class="list-image-[url(images/check.svg)] text-xl/8 list-inside">
			<li>I like your eyes</li>
			<li>I like your smile, your laugh</li>
			<li>I love your kiss</li>
			<li>I love your hugs and cuddles</li>
			<li>You are my goto place whenever I was low</li>
			<li>I like how we both supported each other when we were going through tough phases</li>
			<li>You are my sukun</li>
			<li>I like listening to you, travelling with you, sleeping in your arms, in your lap</li>
			<li>I like walking with you, hands in hands, and those awkward moments where you start talking nonsense</li>
			<li>I like the moments of fast walks and when I always use to loose to you (intentionally) and then you
				celebrated your wins</li>
			<li>I like making morning coffee for you, "the perfect coffee"</li>
			<li>I like waking up next to you, watching your messed-up face, sleeping peacefully, just you being you</li>
			<li>I like when you look at me, those glittering eyes</li>
			<li>I like when you yell at me, cry for me, care for me, nobody has done that for me</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="mt-6">
			<p class="text-xl/8 text-justify md:text-center ordinal">Well the list's already more than 10 and it goes on and
				on... <br>
				Babu you make me feel alive. You make me feel I exists. I like being with you, waking up for you,
				working for
				you, providing for you.
				<span class="underline decoration-pink-500">There's nothing better happened to me than you coming in my life</span>. I still remember the time when you
				walked in my classroom for the first time in std 9th, and that "ting" in my heart. All that chaos, and
				then that "ting".
				a moment so pure and magical that I knew, right then and there, I was already yours. Since that day,
				nothing has ever mattered to me as much as you. I never truly understood what it meant to care for
				someone until I started caring for you. Your
				mere exsistance gives me a purpose. I have planned everything in my head.
				A beautiful house, a decent car, backyard, pool, with cuties playing and a life filled with endless love
				and laughter. Ahhh... man I can
				already feel
				the peace <span class="font-semibold">"The sukun"</span>.
				All I want is to make your life easy, beautiful, and overflowing with love and happiness. You are my
				everything, my dream, my forever.<br>
				Happy Birthday, my love. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
